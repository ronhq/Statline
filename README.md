# Statline – Advanced NBA Player Analysis (2024–25)

**Statline** evaluates player performance during the 2024–25 NBA season using advanced metrics, offering a clear perspective on efficiency, usage, and two-way impact.  
It is designed as both an analytics resource and a practical project for applying data science techniques in sports.

## Key Metrics
- **PER (Player Efficiency Rating):** Per-minute productivity relative to league average.  
- **TS% (True Shooting Percentage):** Shooting efficiency across field goals, threes, and free throws.  
- **USG% (Usage Rate):** Share of team possessions a player uses while on the floor.  
- **BPM / OBPM / DBPM (Box Plus/Minus):** Estimates overall, offensive, and defensive impact per 100 possessions.  
- **WS / WS/48 (Win Shares):** Total and per-48-minute contributions to team wins.  
- **OWS / DWS (Offensive & Defensive Win Shares):** Breakdown of win shares by offense and defense.  
- **VORP (Value Over Replacement Player):** Player’s value relative to a replacement-level counterpart.  

## Objective
To provide a comprehensive, data-driven evaluation of NBA players, balancing efficiency, usage, and overall impact on both ends of the court.  
This project also serves as a platform for practicing **data analysis, visualization, and reporting** in a real-world basketball context.
