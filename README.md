📊 Statline – Advanced NBA Player Analysis (2024–25)

Statline evaluates player performance, impact, and efficiency during the 2024–25 NBA season using advanced basketball metrics. This project provides a comprehensive view of each player's contributions on both ends of the floor.

🔍 Key Metrics:

PER (Player Efficiency Rating): Assesses per-minute productivity compared to the league average.

TS% (True Shooting Percentage): Measures scoring efficiency by factoring in field goals, three-pointers, and free throws.

USG% (Usage Rate): Reflects the percentage of team possessions a player uses while on the court.

BPM / OBPM / DBPM (Box Plus/Minus): Estimates a player’s total, offensive, and defensive impact per 100 possessions.

WS / WS/48 (Win Shares): Quantifies the number of wins a player contributes, both in total and normalized per 48 minutes.

OWS / DWS (Offensive & Defensive Win Shares): Breaks down win contributions into offensive and defensive components.

VORP (Value Over Replacement Player): Measures a player’s value relative to a replacement-level player.


🎯 Objective:

By integrating these metrics, Statline offers an all-encompassing perspective on player value, balancing efficiency, usage, and two-way impact throughout the NBA season.
